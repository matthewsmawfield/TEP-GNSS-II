## Overview

This is the website for Paper 2 of the TEP-GNSS project, which presents a 25-year confirmatory analysis using CODE analysis center data (165M+ station pairs).

## Key Findings

- Confirms orbital velocity correlation (r = -0.888, p < 2×10⁻⁷, 5.1σ; 5 M surrogates)
- 56 planetary event responses (25 surviving Bonferroni correction, 33 BY-FDR)
- 18.6-year nutation cycle detection (R² = 0.641)
- 21+ cycles of Chandler wobble (R² = 0.106)
- Network coherence over 25.3 years
